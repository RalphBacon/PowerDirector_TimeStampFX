# PowerDirector_TimeStampFX
A Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 TimeStamp effect on a test video clip.

As Cyberlink have arbitrarily and suddenly withdrawn the PowerDirector 365 TimeStamp FX (which I use in all my videos) I have created a test project here with just that FX timeline (along with a test video clip that I'll be using sometime in future video).

If you download the zip file, Unzip it into a folder of your choice and open the project using CyberLink PowerDirector 365 it might work for you (if you have the TimeStamp FX applet still installed). On my system I can still use it and modify the effect, even though the actual effect cannot be accessed from any of the menus.

Give it a whirl.

An alternative is mentioned in this thread ( ) and seems to work too, but I am unsure whether you have to (eventually) pay for it.
