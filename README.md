# PowerDirector_TimeStampFX
A Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 TimeStamp effect on a test video clip.

UPDATE Sorry, had to delete the project as someone alerted me that there was private info in it. New project file soon.

As Cyberlink have arbitrarily and suddenly withdrawn the PowerDirector 365 TimeStamp FX (which I use in all my videos) I have created a test project here with just that FX timeline (along with a test video clip that I'll be using sometime in future video).

If you download the zip file, Unzip it into a folder of your choice and open the project using CyberLink PowerDirector 365 it might work for you (if you have the TimeStamp FX applet still installed). On my system I can still use it and modify the effect, even though the actual effect cannot be accessed from any of the menus.

Give it a whirl.

An alternative is mentioned in this thread (https://forum.cyberlink.com/forum/posts/list/0/52392.page#447567) and seems to work too, but I am unsure whether you have to (eventually) pay for it.
